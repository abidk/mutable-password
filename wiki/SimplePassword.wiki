If the password factory cannot figure out what mutable password implementation is used it will use the SimplePassword implementation.

This class is useful if you just want to store and confirm a password which does not mutate or you want to maintain backwards compatibility with your existing password scheme. 

{{{
// store password in database
String storePass = "somePassword";

// get password from database
String dbPassword = "somePassword";
Password dynamicPassword = PasswordFactory.getInstance(dbPassword);

// confirm password
boolean result = dynamicPassword.confirmPassword("confirmPassword");
}}}
